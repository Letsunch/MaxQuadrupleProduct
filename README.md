MaxQuadrupleProduct
This repository contains a Python script that computes the maximum product of four consecutive numbers in a given list. The script iterates through the list, calculates the product for every set of four consecutive numbers, and tracks the maximum product found. Finally, the maximum product is divided by 100 and the result is printed.

Features:
Iterates through a list of numbers
Computes the product of every set of four consecutive numbers
Determines the maximum product of these sets
Divides the maximum product by 100 and prints the result
Usage:
Input: A predefined list of integers.
Process: The script calculates the product of every four consecutive numbers in the list.
Output: The maximum product found, and the result after dividing by 100.
